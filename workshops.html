        			<p class="prose"><b>Critical Stress Incidence Debriefing and Diffusing:</b> During times of disruptive change, such as a sudden death, an accident in the workplace, or psychological threat to the safety or well-being of the individual or company; individuals and organizations are sometimes ill equipped to handle such a sudden situation. Others who have been affected by the traumatic situation may need professional attention.  Debriefing allows those involved to process the event and reflect on the impact.</p>
        			        			
        			<p class="prose"><b>Clinical Supervision:</b> For most of my professional career in Employee Assistance Programs, I have been a clinical supervisor to former interns who are now Social Workers and/or Professional Counselors.  The aim of supervision is to discuss cases and professional issues that can help the trainee gain some insight and training to help their clients.  I always believe in the power of mentorship and this is where it begins.</p>
        			
        			
        			<p class="prose"><b>WORKSHOPS:</b> These trainings are offered for an hour to an hour and-a-half.  These tend to be interactive but presentations will be tailored to the audience.</p>

        				<p class="workshops"><span class="purple">Dealing with Loss and Grief:</span> "When we think of loss we think of the loss, through death, of people we love.  But loss is a far more encompassing theme in our life.  For we lose not only through death, but also by leaving and being left, by changing and letting go and moving on.  And our losses include not only our separation and departures from those we love, but our conscious and unconscious losses of romantic dreams, impossible expectations, illusions of freedom and power, illusions of safety- and the loss of our own younger self, the self that thought it always would be unwrinkled and invulnerable and immortal" - Judith Viorst</p>

        				This powerful workshop restores our gratitude to what we had, what we have and what we will be.</p>

Participants will gain understanding in the power of resilience.</p>
